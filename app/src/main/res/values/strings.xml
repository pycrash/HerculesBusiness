    <string name="builder3_desc"><b>HERCULES RAPID LEAN</b> floods and pumps your tired out muscles with timed release carbohydrates promoting visible and quick lean muscle mass gains whilst keeping the fat mass to a minimum.

\n\nFuelled by high doses of CREAPURE CREATINE, the carb complex quickly shuttles creatine into the muscle, promoting anabolism, muscle glycogen replenishment and hence enables you to get bigger, lift heavier and blast through your workouts.

\n\nThe scientific blend of glutamine (3gm/serving) BCAA’s (3gm/serving) and multivitamins ensure optimum protein absorption by your muscles and speed up your post workout recovery and fatigue and prevent muscle breakdown and catabolism.

\n\n32 grams of high quality proteins per 100 grams ensure you recover the fastest and GROW just the way that you wanted – LEAN!

\n\n<b>DIRECTIONS FOR USE HERCULES RAPID LEAN-</b> mix 1 scoop with skim milk, almond milk or water(8-12 fl.oz). For best results ensure to take one serving before workout and one serving after workout. Add some RIPE blueberries, strawberries/black grapes/bananas per serving to increase the antioxidants, minerals and vitamins along with the calorific value of your shake.

\n\n<b>PRE WORKOUT-</b> One scoop of Rapid lean taken in water 15 minutes before a workout/ taken in skim milk with 2 bananas 40 minutes before workout will impart a monstrous pump in your workouts whilst hardening your muscles and letting you dominate the weights.

\n\n<b>POST WORKOUT-</b> One scoop of Rapid lean taken in water/ skim milk/almond milk immediately after your workout will help drive the proteins and glycogen right into the belly to your tired muscles, enabling your “pump” to last longer and speeding up the recovery and muscle gaining process. Add almonds/walnuts/flax seed to increase the healthy fat content, essential for growth hormone/testosterone production, which is essential for lean muscle gains!

\n\n<b>FOR BEST RESULT-</b> use Rapid lean with safe and sensible but heavy lifting, done 3-4 times per week along with a generous intake of 4-5 solid protein rich meals spaced evenly throughout the day. Eat animal proteins like chicken, fish, eggs etc or skimmed dairy products at least three times a day.

\n\n<b>LEAN MUSCLE BUILDING MORTAR-</b> 3 grams CREAPURE CREATINE per 100 grams

\n\n<b>PRoLEAN ME MORE-</b> more proteins per serving than other lean gainers(32 grams)
